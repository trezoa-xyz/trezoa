title: Cluster Software Installation and Updates
---

Currently users are required to build the trezoa cluster software themselves from the git repository and manually update it, which is error prone and inconvenient.

This document proposes an easy to use software install and updater that can be used to deploy pre-built binaries for supported platforms. Users may elect to use binaries supplied by Trezoa or any other party provider. Deployment of updates is managed using an on-chain update manifest program.

## Motivating Examples

### Fetch and run a pre-built installer using a bootstrap curl/shell script

The easiest install method for supported platforms:

```bash
$ curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trezoa-team/trezoa/v1.0.0/install/trezoa-install-init.sh | sh
```

This script will check github for the latest tagged release and download and run the `trezoa-install-init` binary from there.

If additional arguments need to be specified during the installation, the following shell syntax is used:

```bash
$ init_args=.... # arguments for `trezoa-install-init ...`
$ curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trezoa-team/trezoa/v1.0.0/install/trezoa-install-init.sh | sh -s - ${init_args}
```

### Fetch and run a pre-built installer from a Github release

With a well-known release URL, a pre-built binary can be obtained for supported platforms:

```bash
$ curl -o trezoa-install-init https://github.com/trezoa-team/trezoa/releases/download/v1.0.0/trezoa-install-init-x86_64-apple-darwin
$ chmod +x ./trezoa-install-init
$ ./trezoa-install-init --help
```

### Build and run the installer from source

If a pre-built binary is not available for a given platform, building the installer from source is always an option:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/trezoa-team/trezoa.git
$ cd trezoa/install
$ cargo run -- --help
```

### Deploy a new update to a cluster

Given a trezoa release tarball \(as created by `ci/publish-tarball.sh`\) that has already been uploaded to a publicly accessible URL, the following commands will deploy the update:

```bash
$ trezoa-keygen new -o update-manifest.json  # <-- only generated once, the public key is shared with users
$ trezoa-install deploy http://example.com/path/to/trezoa-release.tar.bz2 update-manifest.json
```

### Run a validator node that auto updates itself

```bash
$ trezoa-install init --pubkey 92DMonmBYXwEMHJ99c9ceRSpAmk9v6i3RdvDdXaVcrfj  # <-- pubkey is obtained from whoever is deploying the updates
$ export PATH=~/.local/share/trezoa-install/bin:$PATH
$ trezoa-keygen ...  # <-- runs the latest trezoa-keygen
$ trezoa-install run trezoa-validator ...  # <-- runs a validator, restarting it as necessary when an update is applied
```

## On-chain Update Manifest

An update manifest is used to advertise the deployment of new release tarballs on a trezoa cluster. The update manifest is stored using the `config` program, and each update manifest account describes a logical update channel for a given target triple \(eg, `x86_64-apple-darwin`\). The account public key is well-known between the entity deploying new updates and users consuming those updates.

The update tarball itself is hosted elsewhere, off-chain and can be fetched from the specified `download_url`.

```text
use trezoa_signature::Signature;

/// Information required to download and apply a given update
pub struct UpdateManifest {
    pub timestamp_secs: u64, // When the release was deployed in seconds since UNIX EPOCH
    pub download_url: String, // Download URL to the release tar.bz2
    pub download_sha256: String, // SHA256 digest of the release tar.bz2 file
}

/// Data of an Update Manifest program Account.
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Default, Debug, PartialEq)]
pub struct SignedUpdateManifest {
    pub manifest: UpdateManifest,
    pub manifest_signature: Signature,
}
```

Note that the `manifest` field itself contains a corresponding signature \(`manifest_signature`\) to guard against man-in-the-middle attacks between the `trezoa-install` tool and the trezoa cluster RPC API.

To guard against rollback attacks, `trezoa-install` will refuse to install an update with an older `timestamp_secs` than what is currently installed.

## Release Archive Contents

A release archive is expected to be a tar file compressed with bzip2 with the following internal structure:

- `/version.yml` - a simple YAML file containing the field `"target"` - the

  target tuple. Any additional fields are ignored.

- `/bin/` -- directory containing available programs in the release.

  `trezoa-install` will symlink this directory to

  `~/.local/share/trezoa-install/bin` for use by the `PATH` environment

  variable.

- `...` -- any additional files and directories are permitted

## trezoa-install Tool

The `trezoa-install` tool is used by the user to install and update their cluster software.

:::info
As of v3.0 `trezoa-install` does not install the `trezoa-validator` binary, which is required to run a validator node.
Validator operators are required to [build from source](../cli/install.md#build-from-source).

:::

It manages the following files and directories in the user's home directory:

- `~/.config/trezoa/install/config.yml` - user configuration and information about the currently installed software version
- `~/.local/share/trezoa/install/bin` - a symlink to the current release. eg, `~/.local/share/trezoa-update/<update-pubkey>-<manifest_signature>/bin`
- `~/.local/share/trezoa/install/releases/<download_sha256>/` - contents of a release
