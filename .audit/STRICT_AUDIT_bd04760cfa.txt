No matches found (PASS)

Match count: 0

=== 2) PACKAGE ARTIFACT SCAN ===

Testing crate: trezoa-sdk

Package test blocked by missing tpl-* crates on crates.io
This is EXPECTED and CORRECT - we must NOT publish until tpl-* deps are resolved.

Error: no matching package named 'tpl-token' found
location searched: registry 'crates-io'

=== CONCLUSION ===
Repository scan: PASS (0 forbidden references)
Package scan: BLOCKED (tpl-* dependencies not on crates.io yet)
Status: Ready for dependency resolution phase
